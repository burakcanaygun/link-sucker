Your webdriver needs to be in the same place as the folder. Or you can define your own location. It's up to you.
<br>

Code that will ask you for two values when you run the main.py file.
<br>
These are _user_search_input_ and _user_last_page_.
<br>
The _user_search_input_ value takes the input from you and puts it in the search url, and the _user_last_page_ value determines the page number by getting your input.
<br>
After this code block(_link_sucker_) runs, if there are more than one similar website url in the resulting csv file, the _clean_data_generator_ function clears them. And it gives you a clean result.

If you run the code too much, yandex may block you. Solving captcha may not work. So use at your own risk. 
<br>
Have fun!
